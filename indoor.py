# In a file called indoor.py, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input in lowercase. Punctuation and whitespace should be outputted unchanged. Youâ€™re welcome, but not required, to prompt the user explicitly, as by passing a str of your own as an argument to input.
# User input is needed.
input_user = input("Enter your text here:")
# Uppercase to lower case conversion. Punctutation and whitespace as is.
lowercase_output = input_user.lower()
print(lowercase_output)
